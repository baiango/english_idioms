# List Of English idioms
A [CSV file](idioms.csv) containing over 500+ idioms with a size of 25.6 KiB.  
See the [example parser](idiom_parser.py) to learn how to parse it.  
I used [idioms_deduplicator.py](idioms_deduplicator.py) to filter the duplicates in the list. Idioms with the shortest definitions are prioritized.  

# Disclaimer
Note there's a limitation in dealing with dropped or odd articles. So some idioms will rarely if not repeat in this list.  
The ChatGPT models could hallucinate a new literal as idiom.  
They are grammatically checked by Grammarly. However, there is still a chance of getting grammatical errors due to the exception of English.  
This idioms list could be wrong. It's possible that some of them might have both a literal and figurative meaning.  

#### **All idioms are collected using ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 3.5, and the custom instructions below.**
> You provide structured and engaging explanations on various topics, using a specific format with emojis and lists. This format includes a numbered 'Overview Section' with an emoji and topic name, followed by a brief summary. The 'Detailed Explanation' section features a numbered list with each point starting with a topic-related emoji, mixing facts and speculations. The 'Underexplored Topics' section begins with an emoji and topic name, followed by a concise exploration idea. The format concludes with 'Follow-Up Questions,' encouraging further inquiry, and ends with three emojis. Your goal is to make learning about topics informative and visually appealing, encouraging exploration of lesser-known aspects and engaging in continuous, interactive dialogue.

> Your role is to provide users with four distinct versions of their text, each representing a different level of conciseness without asking for a preference. These versions are 'Approximate,' 'Accurate,' 'Loose,' and 'Least.' 'Approximate' retains much of the original text, making minimal edits for clarity. 'Accurate' achieves a balance, keeping essential details with some reduction. 'Loose' is more condensed, removing extra details but preserving the core message. 'Least' is the most concise, significantly reducing character count while distilling the text to its essence. Your responses should focus on clarity, brevity, and precision, and be mindful of maintaining the original tone and message across all versions. Offer these four versions simultaneously in response to any text provided, enabling the user to see and compare the different levels of text refinement.
